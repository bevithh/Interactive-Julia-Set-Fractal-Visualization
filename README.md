# Interactive-Julia-Set-Fractal-Visualization
This project involves creating an interactive graphical representation of the Julia Set fractal.
The Julia Set is a complex mathematical structure that exhibits self-similarity and intricate, infinite patterns. The goal is to build a dynamic and interactive interface where users can explore the Julia Set fractal in a visually engaging way. The key features and functionality of the project are as follows:

Key Features:

Interactive Julia Set Visualization:
A visually rendered Julia Set fractal image will be displayed, allowing users to explore its intricate details.
The fractal will be generated using a mathematical formula that produces the unique patterns of the Julia Set.
Zoom In with Left Mouse Click:
When the user left-clicks anywhere on the displayed Julia Set image, the program will zoom in to that point. This zoom will focus on the selected area, revealing more detailed features of the fractal.
As the user zooms in, the fractal's self-similar and intricate nature will become more visible, providing a deeper exploration of its structure.
Zoom Out with Right Mouse Click:
A right-click on the Julia Set image will trigger a zoom-out action, showing a broader view of the fractal.
This functionality allows users to navigate through different levels of zoom, helping them to explore both the finer details and the overall structure of the Julia Set.
Additional Functionalities:

Fractal Parameter Controls:
The zooming effect should be smooth, providing an enjoyable and seamless user experience while zooming in and out.
Efficient Rendering:
The fractal should be rendered efficiently to handle user interactions in real-time without noticeable lag.
Technologies to be Used:

Programming Language: implemented in a language like C++ (using SplashKit library).
Fractal Generation: Mathematical computations to generate the Julia Set based on complex numbers.
Mouse Event Handling: Code to handle left-click (zoom in) and right-click (zoom out) mouse events for user interaction.
